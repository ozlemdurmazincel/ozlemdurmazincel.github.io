Coordinated Projects
=========================    
- On-device and Distributed Machine Learning with Resource-Constrained Mobile and Wearable Devices for Sensing Applications, (principal investigator (PI), funded by Bogazici University Research Fund (2022-ongoing): 
Although running deep learning algorithms is challenging due to resource constraints on mobile and wearable edge devices, they improve performance compared to lightweight or shallow architectures. This project aims to explore efficient on-device deep learning and distributed learning for mobile and wearable devices, particularly from the sensor data analytics perspective.1 PhD and 1 MSc students are financially supported. So far, 3 journal papers have been accepted.


- DAKOTA: Behavioral Pattern Based Authentication, PI, funded by the Scientific and Research Council of Turkey (Tubitak), 1505 Program (Industry-University Collaboration programme) (2018-2020):
DAKOTA proposes a behavioral biometrics-based continuous authentication system, which is mainly designed for a mobile banking application. The application is from a local bank in Turkey, and 6.4 million users actively use it. The DAKOTA system records data from the touch screen and the motion sensors on the phone to monitor and
model the user's behavioral patterns. We collected a dataset and applied machine learning and deep learning models for the authentication process. The bank plans to extend this work. 3 MSc and 2 BSc students were financially supported, and two journal papers and three conference papers were published.  

- Efficient and Dynamic Resource Management in Mobile Devices, PI, funded by the Scientific and Research Council of Turkey Tubitak, 1002 Program (2018-2019)
Our aim in this project was to analyze the performance recognition of an activity recognition system in terms of recognition accuracy and resource utilization. 1 MSc and 2 BSc students are financially supported, and we published two journal papers.  

- Efficient Resource Management in Mobile and Wearable Devices, PI, funded by Galatasaray University Research Fund (2017-2020)
We proposed a dynamic parameter selection algorithm, which is called Conawact, for on-device human activity recognition. We tested its performance on the Android platform regarding resource usage such as battery, CPU, and memory. We have published the findings of the study in one article.

- Context Recognition from Mobile Devices, PI, funded by Galatasaray University Research Fund (2015-2017)
The project's objective was to semantically classify places visited by smartphone users utilizing the data
collected from sensors and wireless interfaces available on the phones as well as phone usage patterns, such as battery level, and time-related information, with machine learning algorithms. 1 MSc student was financially supported and one journal paper was published. 

- Activity-Based Crowd-sourced/Participatory Sensing, PI, funded by the Scientific and Research Council of Turkey Tubitak, 2013-2016 (National Young Researchers Career Development Program (3501-CAREER))
One of the objectives of this project was to design and develop an activity based crowdsourced sensing platform where the activities of the individuals related to movement, are recognized with the sensors on the phones and the findings are transmitted to the backend servers where the behaviors of the crowds are analyzed. the second objective of the project was to create a large-scale dataset which will be shared with other researchers working in the domain and hence constitute as a benchmark platform. Both objectives were achieved with one journal paper and 3 conference papers. 3 MSc students were financially supported.
