About
======
I am an Associate Professor at the [Department of Computer Engineering](https://cmpe.boun.edu.tr/) at Bogazici University. Formerly, I worked as a faculty member at [Galatasaray University](https://www.gsu.edu.tr) between 2012-2021 and as a postdoctoral researcher at BoÄŸaziÃ§i University between 2009-2012. I received my PhD in computer science from the [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/), Netherlands, in March 2009. I was a member of the [Pervasive Systems](https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/ps/) research group. I also visited USC's Autonomous Networks research group ([ANRG](https://anrg.usc.edu/www/)) during my PhD studies.

Research Interests
==================  
My objective is to utilize sensing technologies available on the Internet of Things, mobile and wearable devices, and machine learning techniques to build context-aware, intelligent and resource-efficient systems that ease people's lives across different areas: well-being, health, assistive living, industrial applications, smart cities. My research interests are on applied machine learning, human activity and well-being recognition, edge AI in the fields of wearable and ubiquitous computing, the Internet of things, and protocol design for resource efficiency in Wireless Networks.
