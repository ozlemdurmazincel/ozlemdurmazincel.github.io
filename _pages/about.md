About
======
I am an Associate Professor at the [Department of Computer Engineering](https://cmpe.boun.edu.tr/) at Bogazici University. I received my PhD in computer science from the [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/), Netherlands, in March 2009. I was a member of the [Pervasive Systems](https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/ps/) research group. I also visited USC's Autonomous Networks research group ([ANRG](https://anrg.usc.edu/www/)) during my PhD studies. Then, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at BoÄŸaziÃ§i University between 2009-2012 and then as a faculty member at Galatasaray University between 2012-2021. 

Research Interests
==================  
My objective is to utilize sensing technologies available on the Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile and wearable devices, to design and build context-aware and intelligent systems that ease people's lives and improve their well-being. My research interests are on applied machine learning, human activity and well-being recognition, edge AI in the fields of wearable and ubiquitous computing, the Internet of things, and protocol design for resource efficiency in Wireless Networks.
