About
======
I am an Associate Professor at the [Department of Computer Engineering (CMPE)] (https://cmpe.boun.edu.tr/) at Bogazici University.

My objective is to utilize sensing technologies available on Internet of things (IoT) and mobile and wearable devices, to design and build context-aware and intelligent systems that ease people's lives and improve their well-being. My research interests are on applied machine learning, human activity and wellbeing recognition, edge AI in the fields of wearable and ubiquitous computing, Internet of things, and protocol design for resource efficiency in Wireless Networks.
