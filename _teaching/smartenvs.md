**Description and Objective:** This course introduces smart environments across multiple scales and contexts: such as smart homes, smart factories and smart cities. The goal of the course is to provide an overview of technologies used in building smart environments, including communication and networking aspects, sensors, smart devices, pervasive computing, as well as data collection and processing to be used in the applications for smart environments. The role of data analytics and machine learning in developing smart environment solutions, such as smart cities, and other leading applications, is also discussed. Students will explore and design technical solutions implementing smart environments.
